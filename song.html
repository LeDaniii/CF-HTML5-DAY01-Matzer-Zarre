    <p><i>Lyrics of I Guess I should go to sleep</i></p>
    <hr />
    <p>One two three, two two three</p>
      <p>
        <div> <b> I guess I should go to sleep </b> </div> <div>Too hard standin' on my own two feet</div> 
        <div>Been  walkin' too long on a dead end street</div> 
        <div> I guess I should go to sleep</div>
      </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Well I guess I'll take off my shoes Head upstairs and then watch the news
      <br />
      That's another way to lose these walkin' blues I guess I'll take off my
      shoes
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Well upstairs, upstaged, and upset Keepin' quiet is probably my best bet
      <br />
      yet 'Cause I ain't managed to say the right thing yet Well I guess I
      should go back to bed
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Guess I should go to sleep It's too hard standin' on my own two feet Been
      <br />
      runnin' too long on an endless street Well I guess I should go to sleep
      Sleep Sleep Sleep
    </p>
